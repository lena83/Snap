# Snap

Haven't had enough time to implement everything. I have created game only for 1 snap rule - based on face vlaue of the card. I would implement snap rules variations by introducing interfaces. I haven't added tests for that either. 

Overall it seemed 2 hours was not enough to complete and to refactor the code.
